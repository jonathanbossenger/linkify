# Linkify

WordPress has an excellent feature, where pasting a URL onto selected text will automatically transform that text into a link.

Now you can do it everywhere!

## Installation

[Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/linkify/bkkgikibkmalecfagnebbhbacnbhckmh) | [Firefox Extensions](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/linkify-magic-links/)

## Development

### Installation

    git clone git@github.com:pento/linkify.git

### Build instructions

To install dependencies:

    cd linkify
    npm install

Then to start a developing session (with watch), run:

    npm run watch

This will create an unpacked version of Linkify in the `distribution` directory, which you can load in Chrome using the `Load unpacked extension...` button in your [Chrome Extensions](chrome://extensions/) page.
